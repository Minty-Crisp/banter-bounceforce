Equipped with 6 different types of Ammo all toggled from your left or right hand touching either arm's (approximately) wrist, elbow or shoulder's textured markers, aim with your right hand and use your controller's triggers to fire/spawn. Use the various 4 types of projectile and bounce-able ammo along with a shield and platform spawner to maneuver and destroy all target cubes spawned on each level to progress while avoiding enemy fire as well as any giant Death Cubes that spawn! Traverse an arena filled with climbable structures, player portals, ammo disrupters, ammo portal, ammo speedup field, low gravity player field and various obstacles while keeping an eye out for health, bonus point and increased damage power ups that may spawn during level progression or enemy kills. Earn points for every target/enemy killed, level completed or bonus point pickups with 50 total levels to progress through in an attempt to reach the highest score!
